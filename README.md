# Tronald Dump Site

All credit for this being possible goes to matchilling for providing such an amazing API to utilize. Much love and respect.

Here are both the GitHub repo and documentation for the API in case you would like to use as well:  

1. GitHub Repository: [Tronald Dump Repo](https://github.com/tronalddump-io/tronald-app)  
2. Documentation: [Tronald Dump Documentation](https://docs.tronalddump.io)

I might tweak some things about this site in the future. While this site has the potential to make you sad and depressed, I truly hope it also offers some form of comical relief. Have a good day!
